# Workstation Reservation System for Jitume Lab â€“ STVC

## Overview
The Workstation Reservation System is a web-based application designed for the Jitume Lab at Seme Technical and Vocational College (STVC). This system allows students and staff to register, log in, and reserve available computers/workstations in the lab. It includes features for access control, reservation scheduling, and reporting for lab administrators.

## System Objectives
- **User Account Management**: Create user accounts for students and staff with validation, password encryption, and user roles (super_admin/admin/user).
- **User Authentication & Access Control**: Implement a secure login system using sessions with different dashboards for super admins, admins, and normal users.
- **Computer Reservation Functionality**: Users can view available workstations and reserve them for specific time slots, with prevention of double-booking. Admins can manage workstation availability and reservations.
- **Report Generation**: Admins can generate reports on reservation statistics, user activity, peak hours, and workstation usage.
- **Role-based Security**: Super admins have exclusive permissions to create admins, promote users to admin, and manage all user roles.

## Technical Stack
- **Backend**: PHP (Object-Oriented Programming preferred)
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Bootstrap, Bootstrap icons, Sweetalert)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Authentication**: PHP Sessions, optional use of tokens
- **Optional**: AJAX for smoother user experience

## Key Features
- Responsive User Interface
- Role-based access (User vs Admin vs Super Admin)
- Real-time workstation availability
